console-massacre
================

A DnD-like arena fighting game written in Python, with most features inspired by a GameDev.com C++ workshop (http://www.gamedev.net/topic/416783-c-workshop---project-2/).

I found this source code on my PDA just now (thought I lost it forever when my hard drive crashed) and was really surprised to see that it mostly works.

Features
--------

* Random dice-based combat on an arena
* Inventory system
* Can enter a world; there's even a text-based movement system (not much world though)
* Saving the character (loading doesn't work though)
* Item data is stored in an XML file
* Potions (there's an uber-potion in a test room in the actual world)

Usage
-----

Launch main.py using Python 3. Navigating in the menu should be intuitive. One other thing: to see the inventory and the stats of the character, you should enter the game world from the main menu.
